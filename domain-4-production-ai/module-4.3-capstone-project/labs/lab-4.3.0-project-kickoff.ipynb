    "\n",
    "Companies like OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and Meta all follow similar processes when building AI products:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Problem Definition** → What are we solving?\n",
    "2. **Architecture Design** → How will we solve it?\n",
    "3. **Implementation** → Build the solution\n",
    "4. **Optimization** → Make it fast and efficient\n",
    "5. **Evaluation** → Does it actually work?\n",
    "6. **Documentation** → Can others use and extend it?\n",

    "## ⚠️ Common Mistakes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mistake 1: Scope Creep\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# ❌ Wrong: Trying to do everything\n",
    "project_goals = [\n",
    "    \"Fine-tune 70B model\",\n",
    "    \"Build RAG with 1M documents\",\n",
    "    \"Add multimodal support\",\n",
    "    \"Create mobile app\",\n",
    "    \"Deploy to cloud\",\n",
    "    \"Build training pipeline\",\n",
    "]\n",
    "\n",
    "# ✅ Right: Focused scope with clear boundaries\n",
    "project_goals = [\n",
    "    \"Fine-tune 70B model for AWS CLI help\",\n",
    "    \"Build RAG with AWS documentation (1000 pages)\",\n",
    "    \"Create FastAPI endpoint with streaming\",\n",
    "]\n",
    "stretch_goals = [\"Add multimodal diagrams\", \"Gradio UI\"]  # Only if time permits\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Why:** A complete, polished project is better than an ambitious, unfinished one.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mistake 2: Not Testing Early\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# ❌ Wrong: Wait until Week 5 to test\n",
    "week_5_tasks = [\"Integration testing\", \"Fix all bugs\", \"Benchmark\"]  # Too late!\n",
    "\n",
    "# ✅ Right: Test continuously\n",
    "every_week_tasks = [\n",
    "    \"Unit tests for new code\",\n",
    "    \"Manual testing of new features\",\n",
    "    \"Quick performance check\",\n",
    "]\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Why:** Finding bugs early is much cheaper than finding them late.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mistake 3: Ignoring Documentation\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# ❌ Wrong: \"I'll document it later\"\n",
    "def process_query(q, ctx, opts):\n",
    "    # Complex logic with no explanation\n",
    "    ...\n",
