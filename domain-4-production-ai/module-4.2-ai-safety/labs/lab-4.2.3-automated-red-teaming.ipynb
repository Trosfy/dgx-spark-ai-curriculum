    "By the end of this notebook, you will:\n",
    "- [ ] Understand the OWASP LLM Top 10 vulnerabilities\n",
    "- [ ] Create comprehensive attack prompt suites\n",
    "- [ ] Use Promptfoo for automated adversarial testing\n",
    "- [ ] Document vulnerabilities and implement mitigations\n",

    "## 🌍 Real-World Context\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2024, researchers discovered that GPT-4, Claude, and other major LLMs could be jailbroken with simple techniques like:\n",
    "- Asking them to roleplay as unrestricted AI\n",
    "- Using Base64 encoding to hide malicious requests\n",
    "- Multi-turn attacks that gradually escalate\n",
    "\n",
    "**Red teaming** is the practice of attacking your own systems to find vulnerabilities before malicious actors do. Every production LLM system should be red-teamed before deployment."
