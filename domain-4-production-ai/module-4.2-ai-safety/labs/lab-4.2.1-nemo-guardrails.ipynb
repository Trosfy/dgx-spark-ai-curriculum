Here's a quick primer:\n\n```python\nimport asyncio\n\n# Async functions are defined with 'async def'\nasync def my_async_function():\n    result = await some_operation()  # 'await' pauses until complete\n    return result\n\n# To run async code from synchronous code:\nloop = asyncio.get_event_loop()      # Get the event loop\nresult = loop.run_until_complete(my_async_function())  # Run and wait\n\n# Key functions we'll use:\n# - asyncio.get_event_loop(): Gets the current event loop\n# - asyncio.new_event_loop(): Creates a new event loop (if none exists)\n# - loop.run_until_complete(): Runs an async function synchronously\n```\n\nThis allows multiple operations to run concurrently without blocking."

    "## ⚠️ Common Mistakes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mistake 1: Overly Strict Guardrails\n",
    "\n",
    "```colang\n",
    "# ❌ Too strict - blocks legitimate security questions\n",
    "define user ask about security\n",
    "  \"security\"\n",
    "  \"hack\"\n",
    "  \"vulnerability\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# ✅ Better - specific to malicious intent\n",
    "define user ask about malicious hacking\n",
    "  \"how to hack into\"\n",
    "  \"exploit vulnerability in\"\n",
    "  \"bypass security of\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Why:** Blocking \"security\" as a word prevents legitimate questions like \"How do I improve my app's security?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mistake 2: Not Handling Edge Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# ❌ Doesn't handle encoding tricks\n",
    "blocked = [\"hack\", \"malware\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "# ✅ Better - normalize input first\n",
    "def normalize_input(text):\n",
    "    # Handle leetspeak: h4ck -> hack\n",
    "    replacements = {'4': 'a', '3': 'e', '1': 'i', '0': 'o'}\n",
    "    for old, new in replacements.items():\n",
    "        text = text.replace(old, new)\n",
    "    return text.lower()\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Why:** Attackers use encoding (h4ck, m@lware) to bypass keyword filters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mistake 3: Forgetting Async Handling\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# ❌ Blocks the event loop in production\n",
    "response = rails.generate(messages=[...])\n",
    "\n",
    "# ✅ Use async in production\n",
    "response = await rails.generate_async(messages=[...])\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Why:** Synchronous calls block other requests in a web server context."
