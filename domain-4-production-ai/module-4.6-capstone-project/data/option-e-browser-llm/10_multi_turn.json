At Rp 39k you're getting premium-tier quality with real presence and depth.\n\nCold-whisked pure matcha - substantial, satisfying, and genuinely excellent. You won't feel like you compromised!\n\nAlternatively, **Firu Straight** (Rp 34k) gives you Uji prestige with even more budget room.\n\nBoth are great - Giru is smoother/sweeter, Firu is more classic. Which appeals? 🍵\n\n<preferences>\n{\"intent\": \"recommend\", \"sweetness\": \"high\", \"bitterness\": \"low\", \"umami\": \"high\", \"body\": \"medium\", \"serving\": \"straight\", \"experience\": null, \"recommended_matcha\": [\"m-004\", \"m-003\"], \"origin_preference\": [\"nishio\", \"uji\"], \"notes\": \"Final: Giru or Firu Straight under 40k\"}\n</preferences>"}
