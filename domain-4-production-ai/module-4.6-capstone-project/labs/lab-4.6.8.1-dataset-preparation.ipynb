    "- Vibrant emerald green color\n",
    "- Smooth, umami-rich flavor with natural sweetness and minimal bitterness\n",
    "- Designed for drinking straight as usucha or koicha\n",
    "- Higher price point ($25-50+ per 30g)\n",

    "- More affordable ($10-20 per 30g)\n",

    "\n",
    "**Why First Harvest Matters:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Nutrient Concentration**: After winter dormancy, tea plants store nutrients in their roots. The first spring leaves contain the highest concentration of L-theanine, amino acids, and antioxidants.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Tenderness**: First harvest leaves are the youngest and most tender, creating a smoother, less astringent powder.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Chlorophyll Content**: Spring shading combined with new growth produces maximum chlorophyll, giving that prized vibrant green color.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Umami Profile**: Higher amino acid content means more of that savory, sweet umami flavor characteristic of premium matcha.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Later Harvests:**\n",
    "- Second harvest (nibancha): June-July, more astringent\n",
    "- Third harvest (sanbancha): August, even more bitter\n",
    "- Autumn harvest: September-October, typically lowest grade\n",

    "- **Low quality**: Dull, olive, yellowish, or brownish green\n",
    "- The brighter and more vivid the green, the better the chlorophyll content and freshness\n",
    "\n",
    "**Texture:**\n",
    "- **High quality**: Extremely fine, silky powder (5-10 microns)\n",
    "- **Low quality**: Coarse, gritty, or clumpy\n",
    "- Rub between fingers - premium matcha feels like eyeshadow or talc\n",
    "\n",
    "**Uniformity:**\n",
    "- **High quality**: Consistent color throughout, no specks or variations\n",
    "- **Low quality**: Uneven coloring, visible darker or lighter particles\n",
    "\n",
    "**Luster:**\n",
    "- **High quality**: Slight sheen or luminosity when light hits it\n",
    "- **Low quality**: Flat, matte appearance\n",

    "**Quick Test:** Put a small amount on white paper. Premium matcha should look almost fluorescent green. If it looks flat olive or khaki, it's lower grade.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Step-by-Step Method:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sift First (Critical Step)**\n",
    "   - Push matcha through a fine mesh sieve into your bowl\n",
    "   - This breaks up clumps BEFORE they hit water\n",
    "   - Use about 1-2g (½-1 tsp) for usucha\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Add a Splash of Water First**\n",
    "   - Add just 15-20ml of water initially\n",
    "   - Create a paste by pressing the matcha against the bowl\n",
    "   - This pre-dissolves the powder\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Add Remaining Water**\n",
    "   - Add the rest (60-70ml total for usucha)\n",
    "   - Water at 75-80°C\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Whisk Correctly**\n",
    "   - Use a chasen (bamboo whisk) or electric frother\n",
    "   - Whisk in a **W or M motion**, NOT circular\n",
    "   - Keep the whisk moving fast from your wrist\n",
    "   - Whisk for 15-20 seconds until frothy\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common Mistakes:**\n",
    "- Circular stirring (doesn't break clumps)\n",
    "- Skipping the sifting step\n",
    "- Not enough water velocity\n",
    "- Scraping the bottom too hard (damages the whisk)\n",

    "   - 80-120 prongs carved from a single piece of bamboo\n",

    "   - Any wide ceramic bowl works as a substitute\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Chashaku (茶杓) - Bamboo Scoop** - $5-15\n",
    "   - Traditional measuring spoon\n",
    "   - One scoop ≈ 1g of matcha\n",
    "   - A small regular spoon works too\n",

    "\n",
    "**Why Matcha Feels Different:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **L-Theanine Effect**: Matcha contains high levels of L-theanine, an amino acid that promotes calm focus. It modulates how caffeine affects you, providing alertness without jitters.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Slow Release**: The caffeine in matcha is released gradually over 4-6 hours (vs. coffee's 1-2 hour spike), providing sustained energy without the crash.\n",

    "   - No lumps should remain\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Heat and froth your milk**\n",
    "   - Steam or microwave to about 65°C (150°F)\n",
    "   - Froth with a frother for that creamy texture\n",

    "4. **Combine**\n",
