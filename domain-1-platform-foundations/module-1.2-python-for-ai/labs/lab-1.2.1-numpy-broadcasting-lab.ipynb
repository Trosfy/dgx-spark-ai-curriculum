When you:\n- Add bias to all neurons in a layer → **Broadcasting**\n- Normalize a batch of images → **Broadcasting**\n- Compute attention scores in a Transformer → **Broadcasting**\n\nThe difference between loop-based and broadcasted code can mean:\n- Training in 2 hours vs. 2 weeks\n- Running on your laptop vs. needing a cluster\n\n**Real example:** GPT-style models compute attention for millions of token pairs simultaneously using broadcasting. Without it, language models would be impossibly slow.\n\n---"
