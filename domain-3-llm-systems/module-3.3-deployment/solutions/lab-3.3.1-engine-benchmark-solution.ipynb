    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Prompt Length Impact**: Longer prompts increase TTFT due to prefill processing. TensorRT-LLM handles this best.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Saturation Point**: Every engine has a point where adding more concurrency provides diminishing returns. Operating below this point ensures stable latency.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Trade-offs**:\n",
    "   - Low concurrency: Best per-request latency\n",
    "   - High concurrency (below saturation): Best throughput\n",
    "   - Above saturation: Degraded performance for everyone\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Engine Comparison**:\n",
    "   - Ollama: Great for development, saturates early\n",
    "   - vLLM: Handles high concurrency well with continuous batching\n",
    "   - TensorRT-LLM: Best prefill speed, moderate decode\n",
    "   - SGLang: Good all-rounder with speculative decoding"
