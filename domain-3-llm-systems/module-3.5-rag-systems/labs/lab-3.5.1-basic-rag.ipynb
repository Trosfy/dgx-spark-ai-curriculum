Employees waste hours searching for information. A chatbot that just uses an LLM hallucinates answers because it wasn't trained on your company's data.\n\n**The Solution:** RAG! Build a system that retrieves relevant internal documents and uses them to generate accurate, grounded answers. This is how ChatGPT Enterprise, Microsoft Copilot, and Google's NotebookLM work.\n\n**Why This Matters:** RAG is the #1 most requested skill in LLM job postings. It's how you make LLMs actually useful for business applications.\n\n---"

    "### Mistake 1: Chunks Too Small\n",

    "# ❌ Wrong: Tiny chunks lose context\n",
    "splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=100, chunk_overlap=0)\n",
    "\n",
    "# ✅ Right: Balanced chunk size with overlap\n",
    "splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=512, chunk_overlap=50)\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Why:** Tiny chunks might only contain \"The model uses...\" without explaining WHAT it uses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mistake 2: No Overlap Between Chunks\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# ❌ Wrong: No overlap\n",
    "splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=512, chunk_overlap=0)\n",
    "\n",
    "# ✅ Right: 10-20% overlap\n",
    "splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=512, chunk_overlap=50)\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Why:** Without overlap, a key sentence split between chunks is never fully retrievable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mistake 3: Not Normalizing Embeddings\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# ❌ Wrong: Embeddings not normalized\n",
    "embedding_model = HuggingFaceEmbeddings(model_name=\"...\")\n",

    "    encode_kwargs={\"normalize_embeddings\": True}\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",

    "# ❌ Wrong: No guidance for missing info\n",
