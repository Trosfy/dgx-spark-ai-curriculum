    "### Mistake 1: Wrong Image Format\n",

    "# ❌ Wrong: Using RGBA image directly\n",
    "image = Image.open(\"screenshot.png\")  # May have alpha channel!\n",
    "inputs = processor(images=image, ...)  # Can cause errors\n",

    "image = Image.open(\"screenshot.png\").convert(\"RGB\")\n",
    "inputs = processor(images=image, ...)\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Why:** VLMs expect RGB images. RGBA (with transparency) or grayscale can cause silent errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mistake 2: Forgetting to Move Inputs to GPU\n",

    "# ❌ Wrong: Inputs on CPU, model on GPU\n",
    "inputs = processor(text=prompt, images=image, return_tensors=\"pt\")\n",
    "outputs = model.generate(**inputs)  # Error!\n",
    "\n",
    "# ✅ Right: Move inputs to same device as model\n",

    "inputs = {k: v.to(model.device) for k, v in inputs.items()}\n",
    "outputs = model.generate(**inputs)\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Why:** PyTorch requires all tensors to be on the same device.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mistake 3: Running Out of Memory\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# ❌ Wrong: Loading multiple large models\n",
    "clip_model = CLIPModel.from_pretrained(...)  # 2GB\n",
    "llava_model = LlavaForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(...)  # 16GB\n",
