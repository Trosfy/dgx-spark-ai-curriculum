    "  ✅ Visual configuration with validation\n",
    "  ✅ Real-time training monitoring\n",
    "  ✅ Built-in chat testing\n",
    "  ✅ One-click export to multiple formats\n",
    "  ✅ Presets for common configurations\n",
    "  ✅ Great for learning and prototyping\n",
    "\n",
    "Cons:\n",
    "  ❌ Less flexibility for custom training loops\n",
    "  ❌ Harder to integrate into CI/CD pipelines\n",
    "  ❌ Limited access to advanced features\n",
    "  ❌ Requires running web server\n",
    "  ❌ Debugging can be harder\n",
    "\n",
    "SCRIPT-BASED (CUSTOM CODE)\n",
    "--------------------------\n",
    "Pros:\n",
    "  ✅ Maximum control and flexibility\n",
    "  ✅ Easy to version control\n",
    "  ✅ Integrates with CI/CD and MLOps\n",
    "  ✅ Custom training loops possible\n",
    "  ✅ Advanced debugging and profiling\n",
    "  ✅ Reproducible experiments\n",
    "\n",
    "Cons:\n",
    "  ❌ Requires Python/ML expertise\n",
    "  ❌ More boilerplate code\n",
    "  ❌ No visual monitoring (need external tools)\n",
    "  ❌ Manual configuration management\n",
    "\n",
    "WHEN TO USE EACH\n",
    "----------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Use LLaMA Factory when:\n",
    "  • Learning fine-tuning for the first time\n",
    "  • Quick experiments and prototyping\n",
    "  • You want visual feedback during training\n",
    "  • Standard fine-tuning (SFT, LoRA, DPO) is sufficient\n",
    "  • Non-programmers need to run training\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Scripts when:\n",
    "  • Production pipelines and automation\n",
    "  • Custom training logic required\n",
    "  • Integration with existing MLOps tools\n",
    "  • Need maximum control over every aspect\n",
    "  • Running on headless servers (no GUI)\n",
    "  • Reproducibility is critical\n",
    "\n",
    "HYBRID APPROACH (RECOMMENDED)\n",
    "-----------------------------\n",
    "1. Use LLaMA Factory UI for initial experiments\n",
    "2. Export the configuration once satisfied\n",

    "\n",
    "ISSUE: Web UI Won't Start\n",
    "-------------------------\n",
