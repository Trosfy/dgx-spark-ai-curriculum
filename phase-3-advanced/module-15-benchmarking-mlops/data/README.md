# Data Directory

This directory stores runtime-generated data from the module notebooks.

## Directory Structure

After running the notebooks, this directory will contain:

```
data/
├── benchmark_results/     # Output from lm-eval benchmark runs (notebook 01)
│   ├── phi2_quick_test/
│   ├── phi2_benchmark/
│   └── ...
├── versioned/            # Sample data for versioning examples (notebook 04)
│   └── train_v1.json
└── README.md
```

## Notes

- **Data files are generated by running the notebooks** - they are not included in the repository
- **Results are stored locally** on your DGX Spark system
- **Benchmark results** include JSON files with model performance metrics
- **Versioned data** demonstrates dataset versioning techniques

## Cleanup

To clear all generated data:

```bash
# Remove benchmark results
rm -rf benchmark_results/

# Remove versioned sample data
rm -rf versioned/
```

## Experiment Naming Convention

When running benchmarks, results are organized by:
- Model name (e.g., `phi2_benchmark/`, `llama_benchmark/`)
- Timestamp subdirectories within each model folder
- `results.json` containing the actual benchmark scores

See notebook 01 for details on the benchmark output format.
