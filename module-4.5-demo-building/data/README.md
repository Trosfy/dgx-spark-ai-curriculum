# Sample Data for Module 4.5

This directory contains sample data files for testing demo applications.

## Files

### sample_documents/

Sample documents for testing RAG demo applications:

- `sample_text.txt` - A sample text document about machine learning
- `sample_guide.md` - A markdown guide document

## Usage

These files can be uploaded to the RAG demo applications created in the labs
to test document indexing and question-answering functionality.

## Creating Your Own Test Data

For your own demos, create documents that:
1. Are small enough to process quickly (< 1MB each)
2. Contain diverse content to showcase different query types
3. Include known facts you can verify in responses
