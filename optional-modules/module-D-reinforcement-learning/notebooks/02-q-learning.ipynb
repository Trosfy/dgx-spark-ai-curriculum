Here are the key components:\n\n| Component | Description |\n|-----------|-------------|\n| `gym.make(env_name)` | Creates an environment instance |\n| `env.observation_space` | Describes the state space (`.n` gives number of discrete states) |\n| `env.action_space` | Describes the action space (`.n` gives number of actions) |\n| `env.reset()` | Resets environment, returns `(initial_state, info_dict)` |\n| `env.step(action)` | Takes action, returns `(next_state, reward, terminated, truncated, info)` |\n| `env.action_space.sample()` | Returns a random valid action |\n\n**Key return values from `env.step()`:**\n- `next_state`: The state after taking the action\n- `reward`: Immediate reward received\n- `terminated`: True if episode ended naturally (goal/failure)\n- `truncated`: True if episode was cut short (time limit)\n- `info`: Additional diagnostic information (often unused)\n\n**Note on byte strings:** The environment map uses byte strings (e.g., `b'H'` for Hole). To compare, use `== b'H'` or decode with `.decode('utf-8')`.\n\n### Key NumPy Functions for Q-Learning\n\nWe'll use these NumPy functions throughout the lab:\n\n- `np.argmax(array)`: Returns the **index** of the maximum value. Essential for finding the best action!\n- `np.random.randint(low, high)`: Returns a random integer in range [low, high)\n- `np.convolve(array, kernel, mode)`: Used for smoothing data in visualizations"
