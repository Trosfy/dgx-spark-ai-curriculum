# Optional Modules

**Priority:** P3 (Optional - Advanced Topics)
**Total Duration:** 30-38 hours

---

## Overview

These optional modules cover advanced topics that extend beyond the core curriculum. They're designed for learners who want to dive deeper into specific areas, whether for research, career specialization, or personal interest.

**Not required for completion.** The core curriculum (Domains 1-4) provides a comprehensive AI/ML education. These modules are for those who want more.

## When to Tackle Optional Modules

**During the curriculum:**
- After completing relevant prerequisites
- When you have extra time and energy
- If a topic is directly relevant to your capstone

**After completing the core curriculum:**
- To specialize in a specific area
- To prepare for research roles
- To explore interests at your own pace
