    "## Common Mistakes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mistake 1: Forgetting to call super().__init__()\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# ❌ Wrong - module won't work properly\n",
    "class BadModule(nn.Module):\n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "        self.linear = nn.Linear(10, 10)\n",
    "\n",
    "# ✅ Right - always call super first\n",
    "class GoodModule(nn.Module):\n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "        super().__init__()  # ESSENTIAL!\n",
    "        self.linear = nn.Linear(10, 10)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why:** Without `super().__init__()`, PyTorch can't track your parameters!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mistake 2: Not matching skip connection dimensions\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# ❌ Wrong - dimensions don't match, will crash\n",
    "class BrokenBlock(nn.Module):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, in_ch, out_ch, stride=2):\n",
    "        super().__init__()\n",
    "        self.conv = nn.Conv2d(in_ch, out_ch, 3, stride, 1)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def forward(self, x):\n",
    "        return self.conv(x) + x  # ERROR: x is wrong size!\n",
    "\n",
    "# ✅ Right - use shortcut to match dimensions\n",
    "class FixedBlock(nn.Module):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, in_ch, out_ch, stride=2):\n",
    "        super().__init__()\n",
    "        self.conv = nn.Conv2d(in_ch, out_ch, 3, stride, 1)\n",
    "        self.shortcut = nn.Conv2d(in_ch, out_ch, 1, stride)  # Match dimensions!\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def forward(self, x):\n",
    "        return self.conv(x) + self.shortcut(x)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mistake 3: Using bias with BatchNorm\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# ❌ Wasteful - redundant bias\n",
    "self.conv = nn.Conv2d(64, 64, 3, padding=1, bias=True)\n",
    "self.bn = nn.BatchNorm2d(64)\n",
    "\n",
    "# ✅ Better - BatchNorm has its own bias\n",
    "self.conv = nn.Conv2d(64, 64, 3, padding=1, bias=False)\n",
    "self.bn = nn.BatchNorm2d(64)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why:** BatchNorm normalizes and then applies its own learnable bias, making the conv bias redundant."
