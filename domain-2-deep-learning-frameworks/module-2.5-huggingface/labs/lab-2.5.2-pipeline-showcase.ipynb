You need to:\n- Analyze sentiment of incoming messages\n- Extract key entities (product names, dates, prices)\n- Answer common questions automatically\n- Summarize long customer complaints\n- Generate response drafts\n\nWith **Hugging Face Pipelines**, you can prototype ALL of these in under 10 minutes!"
