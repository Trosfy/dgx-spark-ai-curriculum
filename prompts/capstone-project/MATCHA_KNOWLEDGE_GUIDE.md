## 1. Matcha Taste Profile Vocabulary

### Primary Taste Descriptors

| Term | Definition | Chemical Source | Quality Indication |
|------|------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Umami** | Savory, brothy depth; satisfying richness that balances sweetness and vegetal character | L-theanine (amino acid) + glutamates | Strong umami = high quality; indicates proper shading and first harvest |
| **Sweetness** | Natural sweet notes without added sugar; often emerges as aftertaste | L-theanine, soluble sugars | High natural sweetness = premium grade |
| **Bitterness** | Mild bitter note that provides balance; detected on back of tongue | Catechins (especially EGCG), caffeine | Subtle = good; harsh/dominant = lower quality |
| **Astringency** | Puckering, drying sensation in entire mouth (mouthfeel, not a taste) | Tannins binding to saliva proteins | Minimal = premium; excessive = poor quality or oversteeped |
| **Vegetal** | Fresh plant-like flavor reminiscent of steamed greens, spinach | Chlorophyll, organic compounds | Core matcha character; should be fresh, not stale |
| **Grassy** | Fresh-cut lawn notes | Volatile organic compounds | Fresh = positive; overpowering = lower quality |
| **Marine/Oceanic** | Subtle seaweed or sea breeze notes | Dimethyl sulfide, mineral content | Associated with high-mineral terroir and umami-rich matcha |

### Secondary and Subtle Notes

| Term | Definition | When Present |
|------|------------|--------------|
| **Creamy** | Rich, dairy-like mouthfeel without dairy | Premium ceremonial matcha, proper preparation |
| **Nutty** | Almond, chestnut, or walnut undertones | Quality matcha; characteristic of certain cultivars (Gokou, Samidori) |
| **Floral** | Delicate jasmine or violet aromatics | Premium grades, especially from Uji |
| **Buttery** | Smooth, rich butter-like quality | High-grade ceremonial matcha |
| **Chlorophyll** | Fresh "green" taste | Properly shaded, young leaves |
| **Hay-like** | Dried grass notes | Indicates staleness or late harvest |

### Mouthfeel and Texture Terms

| Term | Definition | Quality Indication |
|------|------------|-------------------|
| **Smooth** | Absence of grittiness | Fine grinding (5-10μm particles) |
| **Silky/Velvety** | Refined, elegant texture; particles suspend perfectly | Ultra-fine stone grinding |
| **Full-bodied** | Rich, substantial presence on palate | Concentrated flavor, quality processing |
| **Thin/Watery** | Lacking body | Poor quality or over-dilution |
| **Coating** | Pleasant lingering sensation on tongue | Premium grade matcha |
| **Granular** | Detectable particle texture | Coarse grinding or ball-mill processing |

### Chemical Quality Correlations

The **L-theanine to catechin ratio** is the primary determinant of taste quality:
- **High L-theanine + Low catechins** = Sweet, umami-rich, smooth (premium)
- **Low L-theanine + High catechins** = Bitter, astringent (culinary)

**L-theanine content by grade:**
- Ceremonial: **16-21+ mg/g**

| "Complex, interesting" | Gokou, Asahi |

---

### Blending Practices (Gogumi 合組)

**Why Producers Blend:**
1. **Consistency** — Climate variations affect each harvest; blending maintains reliable flavor
2. **Complexity** — Single cultivars rarely excel in aroma, taste, AND color simultaneously
3. **Cost management** — Premium cultivars are expensive; blending enables quality at lower prices
4. **Balance** — Some cultivars too bold or one-dimensional alone
5. **Traditional practice** — Named poetic blends are standard in tea ceremony

**The Three-Part Blend Principle:** Traditional blends balance:
- 香り (kaori) — Aroma
- 味 (aji) — Taste
- 色 (iro) — Color

**Single-Origin vs. Blend:**
- **Single-origin:** Shows pure cultivar character; more variable batch-to-batch; often more expensive; for enthusiasts
- **Blend:** Consistent; balanced; often better value; works for wider audience

## 4. Matcha Terminology and Glossary

### Grade Classifications

**Critical Point:** There is **no standardized, regulated grading system** with government oversight. "Ceremonial" and "culinary" are Western marketing terms not used in traditional Japanese tea culture.

| Term | Definition | Characteristics |
|------|------------|-----------------|
| **Ceremonial Grade** | Marketing term for drinking-quality matcha | First harvest; young leaves; high L-theanine; stone-ground; vibrant green; typically $22+/oz |
| **Culinary Grade** | Marketing term for cooking/blending matcha | Second/third harvest; more catechins; yellow-green; may include stems; designed for recipes |
| **Café/Latte Grade** | Industry term for milk drink matcha | Robust flavor standing up to dairy; second harvest; not for straight drinking |
| **Premium Grade** | Falls between ceremonial and culinary | Second harvest with good quality; can be drunk with sweetener |
| **Competition Grade** | Highest possible quality | First flush, hand-picked, traditional processing, often single-cultivar |

---

### Traditional Japanese Distinctions

| Term | Definition | Preparation | Requirements |
|------|------------|-------------|--------------|
| **Koicha (濃茶)** | "Thick tea" — highest quality designation | 4g matcha to 30ml water; "kneaded" not whisked | Plants **30+ years old**; first harvest only |
| **Usucha (薄茶)** | "Thin tea" — everyday ceremonial | 1-2g matcha to 70ml water; vigorously whisked to create froth | Standard ceremonial grade |

---

### Processing Terms

| Term | Japanese | Definition |
|------|----------|------------|
| **Tencha** | 碾茶 | "Tea to be ground" — raw material for matcha; shade-grown, steamed, dried WITHOUT rolling; stems/veins removed |
| **Aracha** | 荒茶 | "Crude tea" — after initial steaming/drying, before finishing |
| **Oishitaen** | 覆下園 | "Garden under shade" — the shaded tea field |
| **Ooika/Oika** | 覆い香 | "Covering aroma" — distinctive marine/nori-like scent from shading; key quality indicator |
| **Gogumi** | 合組 | Blending — the art of combining cultivars/batches |

---

### Shading Methods (Best to Standard Quality)

| Method | Japanese | Description | Quality Level |
|--------|----------|-------------|---------------|
| **Honzu** | 本簀 | Traditional reed mats + straw on wooden poles; 400+ years old; most labor-intensive | Highest |
| **Tana** | 棚 | Canopy — black mesh on metal/wooden frame; good airflow | High |
| **Kanreisha** | 寒冷紗 | Modern shade cloth on shelf structure; reusable | High |
| **Jikagise** | 直冠せ | Direct covering — black cloth draped on plants; restricts growth | Standard |

---

### Grinding Methods

| Method | Japanese | Output | Quality Impact |
|--------|----------|--------|----------------|
| **Ishi-Usu** | 石臼 | Stone mill; 25-40g/hour; ~30 RPM | Preserves color, aroma, nutrients; spherical particles; silky texture |
| **Ball Mill** | — | Ceramic ball grinding; up to 20kg/hour | Heat can damage chlorophyll; less spherical particles; grainier |

---

### Umami: The Complete Definition

**L-theanine** is a unique amino acid found almost exclusively in tea (*Camellia sinensis*):
- Produces umami taste; creates calming effect
- Accounts for ~50% of free amino acids in tender tea shoots
- **Content increases 4x under shading** (sunlight converts it to catechins)
- Creates "calm alertness" by modulating caffeine effects
- Responsible for sweet aftertaste in premium matcha
- First isolated from gyokuro in 1949

**Umami in Context:**
- One of five basic tastes (sweet, sour, salty, bitter, umami)
- Japanese word meaning "pleasant savory taste"
- Also found in: aged cheese, tomatoes, soy sauce, fish sauce, seaweed
- In matcha: indicates quality shading and young leaf harvest

---

### Astringency vs. Bitterness: Key Distinction

| Characteristic | Bitterness | Astringency |
|----------------|------------|-------------|
| **Type** | Taste (one of five basic tastes) | Mouthfeel/tactile sensation |
| **Detection** | Back of tongue | Entire mouth (tongue, cheeks, gums) |
| **Character** | Sharp, acrid | Dry, puckering like unripe fruit |
| **Chemical Source** | Catechins (EGCG), caffeine | Tannins binding to saliva proteins |
| **Quality relationship** | Subtle = good; harsh = poor | Minimal = premium; excessive = poor |
| **Duration** | Immediate | Can linger/build |

**For Customer Explanation:**
"Bitterness is a taste you detect on your tongue—like coffee or dark chocolate. Astringency is more of a drying sensation in your whole mouth—like biting into an unripe banana. Premium matcha has minimal astringency."

---

## 5. Taste Profile Mapping

### Descriptive Scales for Matcha Evaluation

### Preparation Effects on Taste

#### Water Temperature

| Temperature | Effect |
|-------------|--------|
| Cold (40-60°F / 4-15°C) | Very smooth, sweet, minimal bitterness, muted aroma |
| Cool (130-150°F / 55-65°C) | Sweet, umami dominant, silky texture |
| **Optimal (158-176°F / 70-80°C)** | Balanced umami, light bitterness, full aroma |
| Hot (176-190°F / 80-88°C) | Increased bitterness, stronger aroma |
| Boiling (212°F / 100°C) | Excessive bitterness, color oxidation, nutrient damage |

**Key Rule:** Never use boiling water for quality matcha.

#### Whisking Technique

- Vigorous M/W-shaped whisking creates better foam
- Good foam = smoother texture, reduced bitterness perception
- Extended whisking (2-3 min) produces thick pastel-colored foam
- Crema should be fine, persistent bubbles
- Poor whisking = clumps, uneven extraction

#### Matcha-to-Water Ratio

| Preparation | Ratio | Profile |
|-------------|-------|---------|
| **Usucha** | 1-2g : 70-80ml | Lighter, more bitter notes, foamy |
| **Koicha** | 3-4g : 30-40ml | Intense umami, creamy, paste-like |
| **Latte** | 2-3g : varies | Matcha competes with milk |

---

### Milk Addition Effects

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Dairy milk | Smooths bitterness, masks vegetal notes, creamy texture |
| Oat milk | Slightly sweet, allows matcha flavor through |
| Almond milk | Light, nutty, less masking |
| Soy milk | Creamy, can complement umami |
| Higher fat content | More masking of matcha flavor |

**Chemical Effect:** Casein proteins bind to catechins, reducing perceived bitterness and astringency.

**Recommendation Matrix:**
| Preference | Recommendation |
|------------|----------------|
| Taste appreciation | Drink straight |
| Daily enjoyment | Latte with culinary/café grade |
| Smooth but matcha-forward | Miruku (higher matcha ratio) |

## 7. Chatbot Response Guidelines

### For Customers Asking About Quality

**Lead with:** The L-theanine/catechin ratio concept — higher L-theanine = more umami, less bitterness.

**Visual cue:** Vibrant green color correlates with quality.

**Important disclaimer:** No official "ceremonial" certification exists — trust producer reputation and sourcing transparency.

**Example response:**
"Quality matcha comes down to the balance between umami (from L-theanine) and bitterness (from catechins). The more care in shading and harvesting, the more umami and less bitterness you get. You can often tell by the color — vibrant jade green is a good sign!"

---

### For Customers Comparing Regions

| Region | Quick Pitch |
|--------|-------------|
| **Uji** | "The benchmark — complex, refined umami, sophisticated. Think 'special occasion.'" |
| **Nishio** | "Smooth, balanced, accessible. Great for lattes and daily drinking." |
| **Shiga** | "Emerging region with nutty, elegant character. For those exploring." |
| **Kagoshima** | "Bold, sweet, excellent value. Perfect for lattes." |

---

### For Customers Choosing Cultivars

**Single-origin pitch:** "Shows the pure character of one variety — more interesting but can vary batch to batch."

**Blend pitch:** "Crafted for consistency and balance — you know what you're getting every time."

**Cultivar quick guide:**
- Yabukita: Common, reliable, good for blends
- Okumidori: Naturally sweet, smooth, rare
- Samidori: Classic Uji, creamy, competition-winner
- Gokou: Aromatic, nutty, distinctive
- Asahi: Ultra-premium, intense umami, special occasions

---

### For Preparation Guidance

**Temperature rule:** "70-80°C (158-176°F) is the sweet spot. Boiling water makes ANY matcha bitter."

**Water amount:** "For straight matcha, about 70-80ml. Less water = more intense."

**Whisking tip:** "Fast M or W shapes until you get fine, creamy foam. Good matcha should foam easily."

**Troubleshooting bitterness:**
1. Water too hot?
2. Low quality matcha?
3. Too much powder?
4. Stale product?

### For Latte Recommendations

**Key insight:** "Café/culinary grade is designed for milk — the stronger flavor stands up to dairy. Ceremonial grade is actually wasted in lattes."

**Pairing guide:**
- Oat milk: Allows matcha flavor through, slight sweetness
- Dairy milk: Smoothest, most masking
- Higher fat = more masking

**Matcha-forward latte:** Use miruku style (higher matcha ratio) or choose bolder cultivars like Gokou.

### Experience Level Recommendations

| Level | Recommendation Approach |
|-------|------------------------|
| **Beginner** | Start smooth/sweet (Giru/Nishio); lattes OK; avoid intense options |
| **Intermediate** | Explore regions; try straight matcha; introduce single-cultivars |
| **Enthusiast** | Rare cultivars (Okumidori, Asahi); koicha preparation; Uji premium |

### Handling Common Misconceptions

**"Ceremonial grade means certified"**
→ "Actually, there's no official certification — it's a marketing term. Look for first harvest, stone-ground, and vibrant color."

**"More expensive = better"**
→ "Price often correlates with quality, but the 'best' matcha is really the one that matches YOUR taste preferences."

**"Matcha should taste bitter"**
→ "Quality matcha should have minimal bitterness! If yours is harsh, it might be the grade, the water temperature, or freshness."

**"I should use ceremonial grade for lattes"**
→ "Actually, culinary/café grade is designed for lattes — the bolder flavor stands up to milk. Ceremonial grade's subtle flavors get lost."
